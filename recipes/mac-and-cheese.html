    <p>Macaroni and cheese -also called mac and cheese- is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar.</p>
    <ul>
        Ingredients
        <li>12 ounces bacon chopped </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour </li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water </li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked short pasta such as cavatappi or elbow macaroni </li>
        <li>/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>/4 teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        Instructions
        <li>Place the bacon in a large pan over medium high heat. Cook until crispy, about 4-5 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Leave 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pan; discard the rest of the fat.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, then whisk until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and whisk until smooth and just thickened. </li>
        <li>Add the milk and whisk until combined. </li>
        <li>Stir in the pasta, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika and pepper, then bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until pasta is done.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to low, then stir in the cheddar cheese. Keep stirring until the sauce is smooth.  If you need to thin the sauce, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Stir in half of the bacon.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining bacon over the top, along with the parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
